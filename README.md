# getnextline
GetNextLine is a program designed to read from a specified file descriptor, up until a newline or the end of a file.  Using linked lists, I can read from multiple file descriptors if needed.  This is an essential tool for parsing through files since I can take the data line by line.  This repo is for posterity rather than updating.  Any updates to GetNextLine will be in my libft.
